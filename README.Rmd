The goal of drake-example is to provide a repo for developing a lesson or lecture surrounding drake-based R workflows. 

A simple drake workflow outlined (WIP):

(1) First --- generate some data:
```{r}
library(here)
source(here("generate_cohort_example.R"))
```

(2) Source the respective `.R` files which define the drake workflow:
```{r setup-drake}
source(here("R/packages.R"))
source(here("R/functions.R"))       
source(here("R/plan.R"))    
```

(3) Run the plan & visualize progress:
```{r}
plan


config <- drake_config(plan)
vis_drake_graph(config)


make(plan)

vis_drake_graph(config)
```

All 3 steps would typically be contained within a `make.R` file.
